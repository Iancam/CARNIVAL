# CARNIVAL

## Overview

CARNIVAL (**CA**usal **R**easoning for **N**etwork identification using **I**nteger **VAL**ue programming) is a method for the identification of drug-specific activated pathways form Gene Expression (GEX) Data or inferred Transcription Factor (TF) Activities.

This is a tool currently being developed by the [SaezLab](http://saezlab.org/) members and is an extension of the previously implemented Causal Reasoning([*Melas et al.*](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ib/c4ib00294f)) method.

The input for CARNIVAL consists of:

 * Discretized TF activities which can be inferred from GEX data through the [DoRothEA](https://github.com/saezlab/DoRothEA) method.
 
 * A list of perturbation targets for a specific drug/drug combination and their effects on each of them.
 
 * A Prior Knowledge Network (as a SIF file) containing a complete and comprehensive list of signed and directed interactions between proteins.
 
 * [PROGENy](https://github.com/saezlab/progeny) scores representing magnitudes of inferred pathway activities from GEX data.

The main idea behind CARNIVAL consist on identifying a subset of interactions from a Prior Knowledge Network that represent possible regulated pathways linking drug perturbation targets to active Transcription Factors. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach (based on a formulation from [*Melas et al.*](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003204)), is being implemented to model the rules of signal trunsduction from one element of the network to the other. Applications include the identification of drugâ€™s modes of action and deregulated processes in a disease by confirming alterations of main signalling pathways and off-taget effects.
